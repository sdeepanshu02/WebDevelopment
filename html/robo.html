      <p class="about"><b> * The base of the arena is made up of white colored flex sheet with a black 
colored line (to be followed) on it, for autonomous line following. </b></p>

 <p class="about"> <b>* The thickness of the line will be 3cm.</b></p>
 <br>
 <p class="about"> <b>* The course line may have any shape out of acute, obtuse and right angle 
curves. So design a dynamic line follower.</b></p><br>
 <p class="about"> <b>* There will be a building boxes (check points) fixed at starting and ending 
points on the arena. The robot should stop at the point where there is 
building, change it’s state automatically to manual, do the needful of picking 
up the small workers, rotate to detect the normal line following line and 
again as soon as it detects this line, it should autonomously change it’s state 
from manual to autonomous again and trace t’s path back to starting point 
and keep those workers in safe-boxes. </b></p><br>
 <p class="about"><b>* Organizers decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.</b></p><br>
 <p class="about"><b>* <u>FARMTRACK : </u>  The track will be rough field track with sharp turns and twists. Both the speed
and control agility of your bot is important if you choose for this track. The 
robot should be able to cross bumps, sandy track, slippery track and the rough 
patches on the track.
1) The width of the track will be around 1 foot for most of the part.
2) Despite the organizer’s best efforts to keep the quality of track intact, the    
  
  track is subjected to undergo wear and tear as machines run over it. The 
  
  machine is expected to perform on such weakened track.</b></p>
